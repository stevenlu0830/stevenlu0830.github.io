      "We often used grade calculators on the website to calculate course grades in order to track the progress of our courses so far. However, lots of calculators we found on the website are too simple such that they’ve missed subtle breakdown of course grades such as the contributions to course grade by one single assignment or one single phase of course project. Perhaps a spreadsheet would help, but you need to create a table, enter the formula to calculate the course grades. For better approximation you also need to take account of dropping or downweighting lowest grades if necessary which makes the formula more complex. UBC Grade Calculator is a web application vibe-coded by Lovable AI to simplify grade calculation process by user-friendly interfaces, buttons and drop/downweighting grade settings, and the app calculates the final grades for you.",
